This template currently has 1 of everything as of 3/21/25

More obstacles and collectables can be added following examples below
Leading/trailing white space for a line does not matter, indentation is simply for readability purposes
Copy the template below and paste it into the LevelData.txt file (found in the assets folder) below
    any text already in file
        - When copying, make sure to also copy the dashed line above the level number as this is what
            tells the mapper a new level is being defined.
        - When pasting it in make sure to have cursor all the way to the left before pasting or indentation
            will do funny things
